<h3 class="border-text">Bumblebee is a fictional robot character in the many continuities in the Transformers franchise. The character is a member of the Autobots, a group of sentient self-configuring modular extraterrestrial robotic lifeforms.

    In the original toy line and animated series, Bumblebee is a small yellow Volkswagen Beetle. In the live action movies, he has appeared as vehicles inspired by several generations of the Chevrolet American muscle cars â€“ with the live-action film versions being a yellow Camaro with black racing stripes. The original vehicle-mode design was based on a classic European Type 1 Volkswagen Beetle.[1] The character is named after the bumblebee, a black-and-yellow striped insect which inspired his paint scheme. Bumblebee is a fan-favorite character and he appears in most of the series and later becomes the main protagonist in Transformers: Robots in Disguise, Bumblebee, and Transformers: Cyberverse.
