<h1 class="border-text">Film Of The Year - Top Gun: Maverick</h1>

<h4 class="border-text">Top Gun: Maverick is a 2022 American action drama film directed by Joseph Kosinski. It is the sequel to the 1986 film Top Gun and was written by Ehren Kruger, Eric Warren Singer, and Christopher McQuarrie, based on a story by Peter Craig and Justin Marks. The film stars Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer reprising their roles from the original film, alongside Miles Teller, Jennifer Connelly, Jon Hamm, Glen Powell, Lewis Pullman, and Ed Harris. It follows Maverick confronting his past while training a group of younger TOPGUN graduates, including the son of his deceased best friend, for a dangerous mission.

  Development of a Top Gun sequel was announced in 2010 by Paramount Pictures. Cruise, along with producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Tony Scott, were asked to return. Craig wrote a draft of the screenplay in 2012, but Scott died later that year, stalling the project.[5] The film was later dedicated to Scott's memory.[6] In 2017, Kosinski was hired to direct, and production resumed. Principal photography, which involved the use of IMAX-certified 6K full-frame cameras, took place from May 2018 to April 2019 in California, Washington, and Maryland. An initial release date was scheduled for July 12, 2019, but it was delayed several times due to the complex action sequences and the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, several streaming companies attempted to buy the streaming rights to the film from Paramount but all offers were declined on the orders of Cruise, who insisted the film be released exclusively in cinemas.[7]
  
  Top Gun: Maverick premiered at CinemaCon on April 28, 2022, and was theatrically released by Paramount Pictures in the United States on May 27, 2022, in IMAX, 4DX,[8] ScreenX,[9] and Dolby Cinema.[10] The film was widely praised by critics, with many deeming it superior to its predecessor.[11] It has grossed over $1.4 billion worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of 2022, the second film released during the COVID-19 pandemic to gross $1 billion, and the highest-grossing film in Cruise's filmography.</h4>
